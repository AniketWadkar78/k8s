# Instructions for installing metric server
kubectl apply -f metrics-server-components.yaml
# give one minute and then check if the metric server is available
kubectl get --raw /apis/metrics.k8s.io/
# if above commands returns JSON output with APIGroup it is working
# try using the following commands
kubectl top nodes
kubctl top pods

# wait for couple of minutes before executing above commands as metrics server takes time to collect the data in the first instance
